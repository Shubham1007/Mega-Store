Today world is full of new  and amazing technologies . From eating food to 
booking a ticket, every single thing is done with the help of these  technologies. 
Our life is totally surrounded by them. And when we come to the technology 
selection, it is very difficult task to select which one is better as compared to 
another.  And for that selection our working model will help it in selecting a 
better choice by comparing these technologies in each and every aspect.   Our 
working model uses some simple data structures for searching like binary 
search tree and linked list.

 4.Opening a file-fopen() if file is not created it will create and happen the process by declaring the Read –’r’ or write-’w’ or append- ’a’ and file closing by fclose() 
 
 5.System(“cls”)operating system that clears the screen. The user can find the product and after selecting a better one can easily place an order and the details of the order will be immediately stored in the database and the new product can be easily added to the existing order.
